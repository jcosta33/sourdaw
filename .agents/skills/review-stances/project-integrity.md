# Review stance: project integrity

Attack every claim that a project is saved, reopenable, recoverable, or safe to leave. Trace each
referenced asset from the exact serialized snapshot to the durable bytes and ownership record that
a fresh runtime will consume. A document commit is insufficient when the document points outside
itself. Hold the snapshot's project identity, revision, asset source and recovery source constant
across every asynchronous write, then prove that the success path clears dirty only while every
witness still matches.

The discriminating probe is a selective storage failure with the other stores healthy: create real
project content through its owning use case, abort only the referenced asset's durable transaction,
invoke Save, clear runtime state, and restore through the production read path. Require Save to
return false and remain dirty while working data stays recoverable; after storage recovers, require
one later Save to persist the exact failed source and a runtime-clear restore to reproduce its bytes.
Also replace or remove the same asset while settlement is held and require the admitted snapshot to
be superseded rather than certified by the later source.

## Lesson from the PR #964 escape

PR #964 (`8a96bdafd6605daa098c2851bdfab2fdeb8a1db3`) removed embedded PCM from live project
snapshots and described the IndexedDB cache as the audio of record. It made the cache transaction's
abort observable inside `persistSerializedToIdb`, but `audioBufferCache.set` still discarded that
boolean promise, while `saveProject` awaited only CRDT and named-project writes before clearing
dirty. An audio-store-only abort therefore shipped as Save=true with a reopenable document that
referenced no durable PCM.

The review blind spot was treating an observed write inside the asset repository as proof that the
aggregate Save observed it. For any snapshot that replaces embedded data with durable references,
apply the selective-failure probe above at the aggregate Save boundary. Restore the old success
path as a mutation; the real import/Save/clear/restore test must fail on Save=true or missing PCM.

## Lesson from the PR #1077 and PR #2822 escape

PR #1077 (`17c4afde8828e5e61e783006e6e907f23ee92db0`) introduced Save's revision guard, but
captured the revision only after the awaited serializer had already constructed its snapshot. PR
#2822 (`367a186e970d9f7a27662a08c6bd6653220d232a`) made the pre-persist capture explicit after
flushing project writes while preserving that post-serializer placement. A synchronous serializer
wrapped in an async function can return a fulfilled promise, leaving a microtask boundary where a
queued edit runs before the caller captures its revision; the old snapshot then inherits the new
revision and can clear dirty.

The serializer's revision must travel with the data it describes. Capture it before reading project
state, reject the build if it changes across any serializer await, and make Save validate that same
token before starting persistence. The discriminating probe queues one real owning edit immediately
after synchronous snapshot construction and before the caller continuation, without adding another
await. Save must fail and remain dirty or persist a snapshot that includes the edit. Tests that only
mutate state during CRDT or named-project writes do not cover this boundary.

An edit can also update a public store while its Automerge write remains deferred to an animation
frame during any later persistence await. Every snapshot-continuation check must flush those pending
writes before it reads project identity, revision, or asset receipts; one flush before persistence
does not protect later continuations. Hold the named-project transaction and the animation frame,
invoke a public owning edit, then settle the transaction before the frame. Save must fail and remain
dirty, and a later Save/reopen must contain the edit.
